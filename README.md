# Buddi6(3).py

A graph that represent the Mean Square Error of Training data and testing data of stochastic gradient descent is plotted with respect to the number of Epoch cycles executed

# Buddi6(4).py

A graph that represent the Mean Squared Error of Training data and testing data is plotted with respect to the number of minibatch iterations executed

# Buddi7.py

Two graphs in which one represent the misclassification with respect to various threshold and another represent the decision boundary is perpendicular to the regression line which classify 2 classes

# Buddi7(2).py

This is the extension of buddi7.py assignment in which sigmoidal function also implemented.
